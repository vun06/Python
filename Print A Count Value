5	Coding Challenge:
6	While Loop - Print A Count Value - This Challenge is to write 
7	code that uses a while loop to print the value of a counter 
8	variable that starts at 0 and loops up to 10.  It should 
9	print 0-9 and then on the tenth test quit out of the loop.

11	Expected Output:
12	
13	  Starting While Loop - Print Count Variable
14	  0
15	  1
16	  2
17	  …
18	  8
19	  9
20	  Ending While Loop
